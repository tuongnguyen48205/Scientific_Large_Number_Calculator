# Scientific_Large_Number_Calculator
A scientific calculator programmed in the language of C, capable of processing large values.

Integer overflow occurs when one attempts to store inside an integer variable a value that is larger than the maximum value the variable can hold. In the programming language of C, such a value arises above the integer 2147483647. However, relatively speaking, this number is rather small as often times different situations, perhaps in industry, require the use of larger integers and hence why this calculator was created. This calculator makes use of arrays in order to allow the calculation of numbers up to 500 digits in lenght. That is 10 to the power of 500 which is larger than most calculations will ever be. This is one possible way to do calculations and get around the issue of integer overflow. This calculator allows for the addition, multiplication, subtraction, exponentiation and division of integers up to 500 digits in length.
